"Here is what I don’t get with this advice.  With the Roth he “could” lose money over the year.   There is no chance of that with the high interest savings.  

If the Roth lost 10%, he’d end up getting 450 a year.  If he leaves it in a high interest savings there is no chance of that outcome. ","The topics that the text comes under are:

"Correct.  The point is that he can’t take benefit of any gain other than the increase itself over the year.  It doesn’t increase his 10 years of payments.   

So it’s either 5350 + 5000 if the market makes 7% but also possibly 4500 + 4500 of the market drops 10%

Or it’s 5100 + 5000 guaranteed of it goes into the 2% savings account.  

After the year he can put the money in the Roth or any other market vehicle going forward.  It’s only the next year that matters. 

So it’s a delta of 250 IF the market goes up that comes with risk.

"might i suggest that a key to this problem actually starts with your attitude   


signing off with ""y'all prolly dont want me here"" and expressing that we are victims of circumstance is a defeatist approach.   the key to winning at this, is to believe you can.   then its starting with a budget.   know where the money is coming from, and going to, and we can help you work from there.

"?   You are forecasting an expected upside of 7% for the year?   Which is of course possible but there is risk there.   In this case his future benefit is measured based on how much he keeps.   He gets no benefit (other than the 7%) in the growth as they capped it at 500/year going forward.   So if he made the 7% he would get $350 for the year and the 500 x 10 for a total of $5350

"Nobody here is qualified to define whose money the survivor benefit is.  We know that survivor benefits were paid to spouses and children but have no real visibility into how the money was treated post distribution.  Is it in trust? What are the terms of that trust?   

We don’t know how it was invested.  Could be in an annuity which is paying off x% which is where the 1500 comes from.   Could be in something else.   We don’t know, nor do we know who owns that vehicle.  

Finally the one thing we do know is that the money from your ex may not meet the threshold of dependent (which I believe is 51%) and therefore the one thing that seems clear is he could not claim the child.   Either the 1500 is yours or your mothers or some other legal definition and half that money exceeds 51% of the child care meaning your ex can not claim the child.  

You have a lot to research legally.  If it’s indeed your money, legally and being administered by your mother outside of some defined trust then you should be given control of it.   Though based on your decision making that concerns me.  

If it’s not and the money is sitting where it should legally, then enjoy the benefit of guaranteed income, hopefully leveraging that to do something fulfilling with your life.",The text primarily revolves around the topic of credit cards and whether the person should close their accounts.

"To clarify a bit more on why people say only pay into 401k up to the match and then go Roth IRA:  it's because IRA has more flexibility.  You can withdraw principal cash (not the growth) penalty and tax free if you ever get super screwed by an emergency. You can also choose to invest in stocks, mutual funds, ETFs and a lot more as opposed to a 401k.  Pay into the 401(ks) up to the match - both you and your wife - then both of you max out Roth IRAs in each of your names ($6k each).  After that, contribute left over money to 401(k) and keep working your way up the 401k savings rates until you both max out.  

Also, you may want to think about diversifying your tax liability.  That's a strategy that's always overlooked.  Think about a traditional 401k and a Roth IRA to help diversify your tax liabilities in the future.  ","The topics that the text covers are:

"Multiple credit cards, should I close accounts? Hello, I had pretty bad credit and I have been rebuilding it over the last several years. When I started this journey I could only get one of those cards that you have to put your own money down first and that is your limit, and now I can be approved for cards with limits like $5000.

Hypothetically let's say that I had 3 high-interest low benefit cards carrying a $0 balance, and 2 mid-low interest cards with benefits like airline points that I use for emergency/purchases. I am not concerned about % of credit used because I will keep it at or under 20%, but I am unclear how the age of my accounts works. Would closing some or all of the 3 lower cards hurt my credit?","The text falls under the topic of managing multiple credit cards and whether or not to close accounts.
