In this case his future benefit is measured based on how much he keeps.   He gets no benefit (other than the 7%) in the growth as they capped it at 500/year going forward.   So if he made the 7% he would get $350 for the year and the 500 x 10 for a total of $5350\n\nIf he lost 10% over the same period he would end up with $4500.  \n\nIf he put in the 2% vehicle he would have $5100 and no risk.  \n\nSo the delta is $250 and risk.

What are the terms of that trust?   \n\nWe don\u2019t know how it was invested.  Could be in an annuity which is paying off x% which is where the 1500 comes from.   Could be in something else.   We don\u2019t know, nor do we know who owns that vehicle.  \n\nFinally the one thing we do know is that the money from your ex may not meet the threshold of dependent (which I believe is 51%) and therefore the one thing that seems clear is he could not claim the child.   Either the 1500 is yours or your mothers or some other legal definition and half that money exceeds 51% of the child care meaning your ex can not claim the child.  \n\nYou have a lot to research legally.  If it\u2019s indeed your money, legally and being administered by your mother outside of some defined trust then you should be given control of it.   Though based on your decision making that concerns me.  \n\nIf it\u2019s not and the money is sitting where it should legally, then enjoy the benefit of guaranteed income, hopefully leveraging that to do something fulfilling with your life."

            "text": "To clarify a bit more on why people say only pay into 401k up to the match and then go Roth IRA:  it's because IRA has more flexibility.  You can withdraw principal cash (not the growth) penalty and tax free if you ever get super screwed by an emergency. You can also choose to invest in stocks, mutual funds, ETFs and a lot more as opposed to a 401k.  Pay into the 401(ks) up to the match - both you and your wife - then both of you max out Roth IRAs in each of your names ($6k each).  After that, contribute left over money to 401(k) and keep working your way up the 401k savings rates until you both max out.  \n\nAlso, you may want to think about diversifying your tax liability.  That's a strategy that's always overlooked.  Think about a traditional 401k and a Roth IRA to help diversify your tax liabilities in the future.  "
